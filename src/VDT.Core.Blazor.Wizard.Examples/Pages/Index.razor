    VDT.Core.Blazor.Wizard is a Blazor component that helps you create wizard components with sequential steps, forward/back navigation, conditional 
    completion of steps, step- and wizard-level events, and more.

<h2>Handling events</h2>

<p>
    Handling events is done with the default Blazor <code>EventCallback</code> struct, so that events can be handled either synchronously or asynchronously,
    and handlers can to omit the event argument parameter if it is unused. For more information regarding Blazor event handling see the official
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/event-handling">Microsoft documentation on Blazor event handling</a>.
